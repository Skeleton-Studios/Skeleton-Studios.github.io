Skeleton Studios is a small team of friends based in the US and UK. All of us have a deep love for video games, and nearly all of us have a vision of our own to create one that contributes to the medium as a whole. Our mission is to be a platform where we can all contribute our skills to each others' projects; and hopefully, turn those ideas into great games for the whole world to enjoy.
